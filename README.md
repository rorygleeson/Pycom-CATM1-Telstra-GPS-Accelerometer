"# Pycom-CATM1-Telstra-GPS-Accelerometer" 



Please refer to previous Pycom-CATM1-Telstra

This is a continuation, we are now connecting the Pycom Pytrack board, which contains an acceleromter (to detect movement) and a GPS sensor. We upload the GPS corordicates to a platfom every 15 minutes, or when movement is detected.
